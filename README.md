# ðŸ“ˆ **Stock Price Prediction**

This project predicts **Chevron's (CVX)** stock prices using historical data (2000-2024) and models like **ARIMA**, **Decision Trees**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **LSTM**. Data preprocessing includes normalization and handling missing values. The models are evaluated for short-term and long-term forecasting, with an emphasis on mitigating data leakage.
